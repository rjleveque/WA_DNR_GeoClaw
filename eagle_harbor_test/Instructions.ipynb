    " - Make sure you have the topo files needed.  Check in the `setrun.py` to see what `topofiles` are specified.\n",
    "   To create them, see `../topo/Download_Bainbridge_Topo`.\n",
    " - Make sure you have the dtopo file needed. Check in the `setrun.py` to see what `dtopofiles` is specified.\n",
    "   To download: `source rsync_from_homer.sh` in the directory `../dtopo`.\n",
    " - Make any adjustments desired in `setrun.py`.\n",
    " - Run the script `make_fgmax.py` to make an input file describing the fgmax grid to be used.\n",
    "   For this example, it selects a rectangular grid of points with spacing 1/3 arcsecond.\n",
    " - Run `make data`.  This creates a bunch of files `*.data` that will be read in by the GeoClaw Fortran code.\n",
    "   It also makes a set of kml files that are very useful to check that things are set up right before running GeoClaw.\n",
    " - Open the kml files in Google Earth (on a Mac, `open *.kml` will do this) and inspect.\n",
    " - Compile the code if necessary using `make .exe`\n",
    " - Run the code using `make output`\n",
    " - Make plots from the time frames using `make plots`, or interactively in an IPython shell, or a notebook.\n",
    " - Make plots from the fgmax results using the notebook [process_fgmax.ipynb](process_fgmax.ipynb)"
